# Welcome to my site

I am an industrial engineer by training and a management consultant by trade. I am passionate about analytics, agriculture, and Japanese cuisine.

I am experienced in digital and analytics-based pricing, marketing and sales, and operations work for chemicals, agriculture, digital media, and semiconductor clients. My work has brought me to locations such as Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Singapore, where I have worked on global teams and delivered significant and meaningful client impact.

I enjoy working in multicultural environments â€” I love meeting new people and traveling to new places.

I have a strong passion for my core fields of industrial engineering and operations research, as well as a keen interest in the related fields of data science and machine learning. I am passionate about both learning these topics at a theoretical level and applying them in industry at a practical level, which I have done and continue to do in my career.
